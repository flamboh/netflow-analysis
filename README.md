### nfdump charter

## How to use
- npm run dev
- access via ssh tunnel on your local machine
- Select date range, a time, or the full day (somewhat slow to load, for now)



## To do
- allow distinct graphs
- make selecting variables (packets, bytes, etc.) easier
- allow choice between log and linear scale(?)
